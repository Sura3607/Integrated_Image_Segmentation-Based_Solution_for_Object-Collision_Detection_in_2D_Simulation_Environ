# **Integrated Image Segmentation-Based Solution for Object Collision Detection in 2D Simulation Environments**

## Introduction  
Collision detection is a critical component in fields like robotics, virtual reality, medical simulation, and autonomous systems, where accurate modeling of object interactions is essential. This study explores image segmentation-based methods for object collision detection in 2D simulation environments, focusing on three key algorithms:  
- **Watershed Algorithm**: Effective for separating overlapping objects, though it requires marker-based preprocessing to avoid over-segmentation.  
- **Active Contour Snake Model**: Captures complex boundaries and adapts to shape changes, but requires precise initialization and is computationally intensive.  
- **Chan-Vese Model**: Performs well in noisy and low-contrast environments but has slower execution due to iterative optimization.  

By analyzing six simulated video datasets with diverse object properties and motion complexities, this research evaluates the algorithms based on execution time, segmentation accuracy, and adaptability to dynamic backgrounds and overlapping objects.  

Key findings highlight the trade-offs between algorithmic complexity and real-time performance. Practical applications include gaming, robotics, and automation, with recommendations to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy.

## **Results**
### Key Findings:
1. **Chan-Vese Algorithm**:  
   - **Efficiency**: Demonstrates superior efficiency and stability in processing time analysis.  
   - **Multi-Color Images**: Leverages color information effectively to minimize computational load and maintain stable processing times, even with increased object count or collisions.  
   - **Grayscale Images**: Relies on edge and shape processing, which may result in occasional high processing time peaks. However, the overall fluctuation range remains narrow, making it more efficient compared to other algorithms.

2. **Watershed Algorithm Combined with Active Contour Model (ACM)**:  
   - **Average Performance**: Exhibits higher average processing times and significant fluctuations, especially in grayscale images or when handling a large number of objects.  
   - **Multi-Color Images**: Performance improves by utilizing color information, but instability and sudden spikes in processing time make the algorithm less optimal.  

### Result Visualization:
- Performance metrics and including processing times, are stored in the `results/Chan-vese_csv/` and `results/Watershed-ACM_csv/` directories.  
- Plots illustrating processing time trends and algorithm comparison are saved in the `results/plots/` folder, generated from CSV data.
